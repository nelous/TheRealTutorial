	This is a real simple reactjs HelloWorld example.
	
	You don't need any FUCKING online code execution environment (e.g. CodePen).
	You don't need to know any FUNCKING preprocessor (e.g. Babel) at this moment.
	
	In this example, you can learn how reactjs REALLY work.
	
	Put this example in your web container and check this out.

<div id="root"></div>

<script>
ReactDOM.render(
	// In the OFFICIAL tutorial, they use JSX in below;
	// The Babel preprocessor will compile the JSX to below code
	React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!"), 
	document.getElementById('root')
	);
</script>
<!--
	Yes. reactjs recommend you use Babel + JSX
	But, in fact, you can do whatever you want
	You not really need JSX; you can use more preprocessor but not only Babel.
	
	Hope my example can set you free.
